                    Sea Freight is a method of transporting large amounts of goods using carrier ships and also known as ocean freight. At Pundi Mas, we can organize the effective transport for your goods by sea freight. Goods are packed into containers and then loaded onto a vessel. With our LCL (Less than Container Load) service, you donâ€™t need to have enough cargo to fill a whole container in order to get a beneficial shipping rate.
